> Over the years, a lot of people have asked us how to play our songs and if we had tabs. We do, actually. We had a lot of people fill in for us that needed to know how to play our songs. I also have the guitar memory of a goldfish, so I try and tab out a song THE SECOND I finish recording a demo of it.
>
> It seems a lot of people are looking for things to do while we are all home-bound, so I thought it might be an ideal time to drop these all into the world.
>
> That being said, we wrote a lottttttt of songs and I don't have tabs for every single one of them. I thought I would get around to re-figuring them out some day, but I have no idea when that will be.
>
> The other thing is we did these all with notepad by hand. I 100% GUARANTEE there are some mistakes.
>
> HERE ARE MY DISCLAIMERS:
>
> - I don't need to see or hear corrections if you find them.
> - If there isn't a tab for the song you are looking for, I'm sorry but I won't be tabbing them out anytime soon. Also, please do not send me tabs of the songs that are missing.
> - In some cases, a friend made a tab (probably for bass) and I also don't have any idea of there are mistakes there either.
> - Some names are probably going to the pet names we called a release or song before we actually named the song. You might have to do some digging to figure out what song it is, lol. Fun!
>
> So, without further adieu, here is where you can download all the tabs: [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/59ejoaymqh469zy/Empire%21%20Empire%21-%20Guitar%20and%20Bass%20Tabs.zip?dl=0&fbclid=IwAR1ZpjN5akZPIt4McfhfU2i15nd5MCRWO9KQ3L-_uIx4oHiOwHs0qFkHdSU)

Empire! Empire! has been my favorite band since 2008. I downloaded the files but didnâ€™t want to lose them. I am archiving them here for safe keeping. Definitely support them on [Bandcamp](https://empireempire.bandcamp.com/)!
