you have to beleive that life is more than the sum of its parts, kiddo
bass tab

i'm sure you can figure out how many times/rhytmn of each part

for example


part 1

G
D --5---5---5-------5-----
A 7---7---7---7-5-3------0
E ---------------------3--


is written like this to save time.

but it's really played like this

G
D ------5-5-5-------5-5-5-------5-5-5-------------------------5-5-5-5-5-5------------------------
A 7-7-7-------7-7-7-------7-7-7-------7-7-7-5-5-5-3-3-3-3-3-3-------------------------0-0-0-0-0-0
E ------------------------------------------------------------------------3-3-3-3-3-3------------

part 2

G
D 5-7-4-5-2-4-0--
A --------------3
E

part 3

G
D
A 7-5-7-3-2-7-5-7-10-9-5
E

part 4 

same as part 1

part 5

G
D --5---------5------
A 7---3-5---7---3----
E --------3-------3-5
